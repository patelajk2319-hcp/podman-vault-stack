# Summary of what this script accomplishes:
# 1. Creates a Certificate Authority (CA) that acts as a trusted root
# 2. Generates TLS certificates for Elasticsearch and Kibana signed by the CA  
# 3. Generates TLS certificate for Fleet Server - For Vault Integration
# 4. Configures certificates with proper Subject Alternative Names for flexible hostname/IP usage
# 5. Sets secure file permissions to protect private keys
# 6. Cleans up temporary files for a tidy final result
#
# The resulting certificates enable encrypted TLS communication between:
# - Clients and Elasticsearch
# - Clients and Kibana  
# - Elasticsearch and Kibana
# - Fleet Server and Elastic Agent (NEW)


# Define color codes for colored terminal output
GREEN='\033[0;32m'    # Green text for success messages
YELLOW='\033[1;33m'   # Yellow text for warnings
BLUE='\033[0;34m'     # Blue text for informational messages
NC='\033[0m'          # No Color - resets text color to default
